But what makes Graceland so special and influential? How did Paul Simon create such a masterpiece? Let's take a closer look at the history and the making of Graceland.
 
## The History and the Making of Graceland
 
Paul Simon was already a successful and respected singer-songwriter when he released Graceland. He had been part of the duo Simon & Garfunkel, who had several hits in the 1960s, such as "The Sound of Silence", "Bridge over Troubled Water" and "Mrs. Robinson". He had also launched a solo career in the 1970s, with albums like Paul Simon, There Goes Rhymin' Simon and Still Crazy After All These Years.
 
However, by the mid-1980s, Simon was going through a creative and personal slump. His previous album, Hearts and Bones, had been a commercial and critical failure. His marriage with actress Carrie Fisher had ended in divorce. He was suffering from depression and writer's block. He felt that he had lost his relevance and his inspiration.
 
That changed when he heard a cassette tape of South African music called Gumboots: Accordion Jive Hits, Volume II. He was fascinated by the sound of the music, which combined traditional African rhythms and melodies with Western instruments and influences. He decided to travel to South Africa to collaborate with some of the musicians he had heard on the tape, such as Ladysmith Black Mambazo, a vocal group that sang in Zulu, and Ray Phiri, a guitarist who played in a style called mbaqanga.
 
Simon's trip to South Africa was controversial, as the country was under the apartheid regime, a system of racial segregation and oppression that discriminated against the black majority. Simon was accused of breaking the cultural boycott that had been imposed by the United Nations and other organizations to isolate and pressure the South African government to end apartheid. Simon argued that he was not supporting the regime, but rather supporting the musicians and their culture. He said that he was making music, not politics.
 
Simon recorded several songs with the South African musicians in Johannesburg, such as "Homeless", "Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes" and "I Know What I Know". He then returned to New York and continued working on the album with other collaborators, such as American singer Linda Ronstadt, Brazilian percussionist Airto Moreira, Los Lobos, a Mexican-American rock band, and The Everly Brothers, a legendary country duo. He also added lyrics to some of the songs, drawing from his personal experiences and observations.
 
The result was Graceland, an album that blended different musical genres and cultures into a cohesive and original whole. The album was released in August 1986 and received rave reviews from critics and fans alike. It was praised for its musical innovation, its lyrical depth and its social relevance. It also helped to introduce South African music to a global audience and to raise awareness about the situation in the country.
 
Graceland became Simon's most successful solo album, reaching number one on several charts around the world. It won two Grammy Awards in 1987: Album of the Year and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. It also spawned several hit singles, such as "You Can Call Me Al", "The Boy in the Bubble" and "Graceland". It has been ranked among the best albums of all time by various publications and organizations, such as Rolling Stone, Time and The Library of Congress.
